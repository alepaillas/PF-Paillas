		<h3>The threshold between worlds</h3>
		<p>For me the virtual had become more real than
		  reality itself, how could it not be?, if the only
		  place where you can really be yourself is in that
		  space, where you can make a fiction of your life and
		  no one else can question you, because that is the
		  internal logic of the world and everyone benefits
		  from it. Or at least that's how it was before
		  Facebook. People who still cling to that illusion
		  now inhabit the peripheries of the internet. It's
		  not a feeling that particularly affects me, it's
		  more like a generational thing, experienced perhaps
		  most intensely by the transgender community, I'll
		  explain why later, first I want to give an account
		  of how things happened.
		<p>In the beginning I looked for a way to show those
		  who are not plugged in, the collapsed wall, which
		  used to be the border between the dimensions. The
		  obvious solutions were virtual or augmented
		  reality. The immediate problem was that the cities
		  were just reopening after two years of coronavirus
		  pandemic, everyone had been working through the
		  screen, and unlike me, they had enough of the
		  virtual world and were anxious for presentiality. So
		  I had to ponder about the interface, since it wasn't
		  as if humanity had turned off the the
		  home-cocoon-machine, to fly free once again, she was
		  still running the social control program in the
		  background.
		<p>If he couldn't use devices that everyone disdained,
		  what could I use instead? The question then turned
		  to essence of these devices, which refers to
		  Heidegger, who he writes: “Technique is not, then,
		  simply a means. The Technique is a way of
		  unconcealing.” (Heidegger, 1997, p. 121); “All
		  production is based on unconcealing.” (p. 120) What
		  is What does a screen, a control, a projector
		  reveal?  Images. They reveal something that is more
		  than a mere representation of reality, are images
		  produced by the input of a user, which exist only to
		  the extent that someone commands their appearance of
		  him. He then had the access code, since “only There
		  is a type of production, the production of the real”
		  (Deleuze and Guattari, 1983, p. 68).
		<p>While I sensed being in the territory of machines,
		  I can now explain how I arrived, or rather, how It's
		  just that we all find ourselves there. The command
		  is an order, which flows from one body to another,
		  this flow is interrupted in a point, processed and a
		  response is returned. The language imperative
		  implies a desire, of the type “I want you to do
		  something” and desire, according to Deleuze and
		  Guattari, is the production of production, to
		  produce in the Heideggerian sense, of start the
		  process. Under this theoretical framework,
		  everything is a system with entrances and exits,
		  through which desire flows, which They are not only
		  orders, but also a desire for life, extends to the
		  unconscious, that assumed to be non-real.  In this
		  world “everything is a machine” (p. 30), that is why
		  understands “nature as a production process” (p.
		  32).
		<p>The machines that produce desire are the
		  desiring-machines, that is a recursive definition,
		  “every machine is a machine of a machine”
		  (p. 73). And what are machines? “A machine can be
		  defined as a system of interruptions or breaks” (p.
		  73).
		<p>What are my desiring-machines? That is the first
		  task positive of schizoanalysis and is linked to the
		  task artistic as a technique, which reveals the
		  truth, a task which entails a necessary openness to
		  the mystery. Heidegger like this he writes it:
		<p>The arts did not emerge from the artistic. The
		  works of art They were not enjoyed
		  aesthetically. The arts were not cultural production
		  sector.  What was art? Maybe just for brief but high
		  time? Why did they carry the simple name tekné?
		<p>Because it was an unconcealment that contributed
		  and produced and because that belonged to poiesis
		  (Heidegger, 1997, p. 147).
		<p>We know then what is at stake, it is what Paul
		  B. Preciado calls the need for a new epistemology,
		  which allow those who have been considered sick to
		  speak mental. Hence it is a transgender feeling,
		  because for society are schizoids who cannot
		  distinguish fiction of reality. And if art can
		  possibly achieve that what a tremendous
		  responsibility! I dare not suggest a response, more
		  than partial and in process.
		<p>Having questioned the method of accessing the
		  virtual world, I came to a key concept, the
		  threshold. The machine is a break in the flow and
		  the threshold is the break point. This takes us back
		  to the myth present in all cultures, the threshold
		  between the worlds. The virtual and the real
		  collapse here. No we must lose ourselves in the
		  representation, something is needed that It
		  effectively connects you to the other side. As I had
		  to create my own user interface, the Arduino
		  platform is It was useful for prototyping and
		  allowed me to use a Lots of modules and sensors that
		  are easy to implement. A distance sensor in
		  particular incorporated my conceptual research: the
		  ultrasonic HC-SR04. This It works by echolocation,
		  like a SONAR or a bat.  It has a detection range
		  between 2cm and 4m, making it ideal for capturing
		  people in a room. Furthermore, the pulse sends is
		  quite directional, capturing objects in its maximum
		  distance at an angle of 15°. For these reasons it is
		  possible to program it as a threshold, where the
		  processor is dormant until someone crosses it, when
		  it comes into range detection.
		<p>The first montages I made were from a computer
		  graphing the sensor data in different ways, when a
		  user moved in front of him. What I noticed is that
		  the graph that was formed was that of an exponential
		  function (Image 1). This line was not programmed,
		  but is derived of the system's operation. The
		  technique has its own internal logic that tends to
		  produce a certain type of result. If you have a
		  hammer, everything looks like a nail to be
		  hammered. If you have a SONAR, every object seems to
		  be accelerating, since the sound reflection takes
		  less time to Get there the closer you are. I found
		  this last fact fascinating, because it not only
		  applies to echolocation, I believe that every
		  revolutionary technique has this accelerant property
		  and I decided to continue the research from this
		  axis.

		  <h3>The acceleration of history</h3>
		<p>When studying the history of humanity, we should
		  pay attention to two things, the first is that to
		  understand it, we divide it into periods delimited
		  by paradigmatic changes, made possible by the
		  introduction of new technologies. The second is that
		  the pace at which significant events occur, which
		  signal the beginning of a new era, seems to be
		  accelerating. Thus, from the homo sapiens sapiens
		  most similar to modern man to the beginning of
		  agriculture, there are about 30,000 years, but from
		  the Neolithic to writing there are only 7,000, to
		  reach the Middle Ages we need 3,500 years, however
		  from there to modernity 1000 years are enough and
		  the first industrial revolution happens 300 years
		  later, after 150 years the atomic bomb was already
		  used. From the transistor, to the moon, the internet
		  and soon to Mars. Technological progress has
		  exponential growth.
		  
		<p>I propose then that the acceleration of history is
		  intertwined with technological development. I cannot
		  say for sure that technology causes time to pass
		  faster (Time, like the mind, is not knowable as
		  such. We only know time indirectly by what happens
		  in it, by observing change and what remains, by
		  pointing out the succession of events between stable
		  frameworks and indicating the contrast of various
		  kinds of changes” (Kubler, 1988, p. 70)) , but its
		  effects undoubtedly alter our perception of space,
		  the world becomes smaller and smaller and space is
		  not a thing that exists by itself, but exists in the
		  time and at the same time, time, as a measure of
		  change, cannot be understood without a space that
		  transforms.  Therefore, both concepts are
		  codependent, the compression or expansion of one
		  implies the same for the other.  The compression of
		  space-time produced by technological development is
		  what I am interested in working on.

		<p>Perhaps the simplest example to explain how
		  technology shortens distances (and therefore messes
		  with the conception of time of the moment) is the
		  steam engine. We cannot simply say that the railway
		  improves quality of life in the city without being
		  critical of the fact that this environment, once
		  established, becomes necessary and therefore ceases
		  to be an advantage as at the time of its creation.
		  Indeed, production increases thanks to technology,
		  but along with it, the standard of production also
		  increases, so the expected demands of human beings
		  are the same as before, or even worse.

		<p>Likewise, “in Germany the trains seemed to shrink
		  time, as if they were a magical artifact” (Garfield,
		  2017, p. 42). Due to the machinic need for
		  synchronicity, society adjusts, “before the arrival
		  of the train, few saw it as necessary” (p. 39). It
		  seems wrong to me, however, to suggest that the
		  locomotive was what allowed man to win the fight
		  against nature, or that it even makes sense to
		  propose such a dichotomy, since "the reference in
		  each town was usually the town hall or town hall
		  clock." church and the time was still set from the
		  midday sun” (p. 39). The cathedral had already
		  established a schedule theologized as natural, but
		  in reality it is something totally arbitrary. That
		  the sun traces a path with a maximum point in the
		  sky is a natural phenomenon, but it becomes useless
		  as a reference when our own paths are so extensive
		  that they relativize it, hence, once a higher
		  measuring instrument arises , naturally people adapt
		  better to it.

		<p>Systematic thinking allows us to understand
		  technology, acting not only on itself or its direct
		  environment, but also to think of reality as many
		  interconnected abstract machines.  The clock is not
		  only a device that generates a periodic movement of
		  its hands, but it harmonizes its frequency with the
		  rest of existence.

		<p>Likewise, “in Germany the trains seemed to shrink
		  time, as if they were a magical artifact” (Garfield,
		  2017, p. 42). Due to the machinic need for
		  synchronicity, society adjusts, “before the arrival
		  of the train, few saw it as necessary” (p. 39). It
		  seems wrong to me, however, to suggest that the
		  locomotive was what allowed man to win the fight
		  against nature, or that it even makes sense to
		  propose such a dichotomy, since "the reference in
		  each town was usually the town hall or town hall
		  clock." church and the time was still set from the
		  midday sun” (p. 39). The cathedral had already
		  established a schedule theologized as natural, but
		  in reality it is something totally arbitrary. That
		  the sun traces a path with a maximum point in the
		  sky is a natural phenomenon, but it becomes useless
		  as a reference when our own paths are so extensive
		  that they relativize it, hence, once a higher
		  measuring instrument arises , naturally people adapt
		  better to it.

		<p>When local time was changed to railway time “people
		  noticed, but, as it was known to be a very precise
		  clock, in a matter of a year the churches and
		  businesses in the city changed their time to adapt
		  to it” ( p. 40). The issue is not only political,
		  but also technical, because precision matters, or
		  rather, technique is political, so “the employees'
		  watches were, systematically and deliberately, five
		  minutes late to alleviate the passenger's rush. that
		  could be late” (p. 42).

		<p>Regarding space-time compression, Marx tells us
		  that: “While capital must on the one hand try to
		  break every spatial barrier to exchange, and conquer
		  the entire world for its market, it tries on the
		  other hand to annihilate this space over time.” ,
		  that is, reducing to a minimum the time spent moving
		  from one place to another” (Marx, 1971, p. 119). The
		  quote raises the issue from the labor theory of
		  value, which uses time as an essential unit of
		  measurement. In other words, greater efficiency,
		  what is characteristic of technique, is what makes
		  the world collapse in on itself.

		<p>Since we introduced Marx, it is pertinent to give
		  space to the philosophy of history. From Hegelian
		  dialectics we understand history as a constant
		  contrast of ideas, a thesis of history, for example,
		  romanticism, can be reasoned as the revolutionary
		  antithesis of industrial technicalism. A paradigm
		  shift is in essence a revolution. Marx's
		  materialism, starting from Hegel, indicates that
		  there is a constant in history, class conflict, it
		  is the oppressors and oppressed who raise the theses
		  of history. If in the past it was easy to identify
		  who had power, thanks to the fact that it was
		  concentrated in authoritarian figures, the
		  revolution consisted of overthrowing the monarch and
		  installing a new regime.  The postmodern problem is
		  that power is no longer concentrated in any figure,
		  but rather is distributed among agents, who do not
		  have sufficient control to generate a change, such
		  as that necessary to replace the capitalist system2
		  
		  (Which for Baudrillard is an impossible exchange. It
		  can't be done exchanging the total of an economy,
		  which is virtual, for using fiat money, since the
		  real thing has lost its value.  “When there is no
		  longer an internal reference system, no “natural”
		  equivalence, no purpose for exchange (as occurs
		  between production and social wealth, between
		  information and the real event), then we enter an
		  exponential phase and in the speculative disorder.”
		  (Baudrillard, 2000, pages 13-14)). However, an
		  external force that controls trade is not necessary
		  for its destruction, in the same free market logic
		  that gives capitalism its ability to absorb any
		  criticism, lies its final destiny.

		<p>Since the market is inherently chaotic, to maintain
		  a stable state, external pressure must be exerted on
		  it; without this, given enough time, society will
		  inevitably would collapse3 (“The more the capitalist
		  machine deterritorializes, decoding and axiomatizing
		  flows to extract surplus value from them, the more
		  its auxiliary apparatuses, such as government
		  bureaucracies and law enforcement, do to
		  reterritorialize, absorbing an ever-larger share of
		  the surplus value in the process.” (Deleuze and
		  Guattari, 1983, p. 71).). The problem is that we
		  would not live to see it, to do so it is necessary
		  for history to happen faster, therefore, "revolution
		  is an acceleration of the flow of the world" (Groys,
		  2016, p. 24). This is where artists come in, who in
		  their efforts to resist the commodification of art
		  adopt a revolutionary attitude, "the work of art is
		  in itself a desiring machine. The artist accumulates
		  his treasures to create an immediate explosion, and
		  that is why, in his view , destructions can never
		  take place as quickly as they should” (Deleuze and
		  Guattari, 1983, p.  The linear model is
		  oversimplified, the exponential 67). Boris Groys
		  notes precisely this, "the flow of events inside the
		  museum today is often faster than the flow outside
		  its walls" (p. 36). Institutions are capable of
		  functioning at an accelerated pace, but their
		  potential is limited, since every institution seeks
		  to preserve itself over time. The type of artistic
		  agitation necessary to cause true change is more
		  similar to that envisioned by the futurists, who
		  wanted the destruction of museums, and even to be
		  replaced by younger artists, since they themselves
		  were also tending towards obsolescence. “We want to
		  praise the man who holds the steering wheel, whose
		  ideal shaft crosses the Earth, launched into the
		  race, itself, in the circuit of its orbit”
		  (Marinetti, 1909). The objective, however, is not to
		  found a neo-futurism, although it is to represent
		  the machine in all its terrifying speed and exalt
		  its violence. Therefore, what I propose is an art
		  that differs in two main elements, despite being
		  inspired by the same issues and drawing attention to
		  their inevitable dystopias.

		<p>First, the focus of the work should be on
		  acceleration and not its derivative, velocity. The
		  purpose of naming futurism is to integrate its
		  function, not to generate its same graphics. If we
		  travel at a stable speed, like on the train, it is
		  enough to cover our ears and close the windows to
		  change our frame of reference and stop noticing the
		  movement.  You have to feel the acceleration that
		  hits you to the seat and makes you lose control.
		  Remove the limiter. Exceed the safety
		  threshold. Break the sound barrier. The linear model
		  is oversimplified, the exponential allows asymptotic
		  analysis, but in the real world we slow down when we
		  reach the insurmountable speed of light, but at this
		  magnitude time dilates, history reveals itself to be
		  absurd, it clashes and fragments, it is not unique,
		  with present, past and future objectives. There is
		  no end of history, nor “extreme promontory of
		  centuries” (Marinetti, 1909), “Time and Space died
		  yesterday” (Marinetti, 1909), but like the hydra it
		  grew more heads. The relativity of simultaneity puts
		  our idea of linear time in crisis. We don't have to
		  make more timelines, but rather lines of
		  flight. Compose fugues with voices at different
		  tempos, individual accelerandos and
		  ritardandos. Playing in an orchestra without a
		  conductor, with actors drawing world lines, which
		  sometimes coincide, more by pattern recognition than
		  by divine providence.

		<p>Second, art must not only represent technology, but
		  be the technique in question.  “Malevich believed
		  that the artist must become infected through
		  technique” (Groys, 2016, p. 137), a bacterial
		  infection, of exponential reproduction. The way in
		  which human- machine interfaces have been
		  implemented is in the black box mode where the
		  operation is hidden. You have to realize the
		  engineering, notice the hammer in your hand and how
		  it turns you into a hammer-man. The fundamental
		  problem is nature: for feminism it is biology, for
		  capitalism the second law of thermodynamics, for
		  politics it is time; We defend ourselves from the
		  natural thanks to the artificial.

		<p>We must be careful, however, not to fall into
		  dualism, it is not man against nature, nor natural
		  origin towards artificial development4 (“We make no
		  distinction between man and nature: the human
		  essence of nature and the natural essence of man
		  come together within nature in the form of
		  production or industry, just as they do in the life
		  of man as a species. “Industry is no longer
		  considered from the extrinsic point of view of
		  utility, but from the point of view of its
		  fundamental identity with nature as a production of
		  man and by man.”  (Deleuze and Guattari, 1983,
		  p. 33).). The cyborg is not an ideal of the future,
		  it is a reality that intersects with the human,
		  primates also handle tools and a sufficiently
		  advanced AI could perfectly handle us. The loss of
		  values prophesied by Nietzsche extends to human
		  nature, God has died and his clay man has died with
		  Him. “Essentialist naturalism reeks of theology –
		  the quicker we exorcise it, the better.” (Hester et
		  al., 2015)

		<p>How exactly is the program to be executed? A good
		  example is the Lines of Flight by Leo Nuñez and
		  Laura Nieves:

		  <blockquote>“When statistics and data become so
		    abstract to us. How do economic decisions
		    influence us workers?  In this work, based on
		    simple home construction mechanisms, we can
		    perceive how the interest rate is influencing
		    unemployment. A high real interest rate, higher
		    than the rate of return on investments, generates
		    a drop in investment levels and therefore will
		    negatively affect the occupancy rate.” (Nunez,
		    2019)</blockquote>

		<p>The work exists at the intersection of mathematics,
		  politics, economics and art.  The technological
		  construct is the beginning and the end of the
		  worker's life. Statistics is not only a measuring
		  instrument, but becomes an end in itself. Maximizing
		  profits comes before social well-being. The
		  elevators that trace the interest and unemployment
		  curve resonate with each numerical adjustment. The
		  machinery in its multiplicity vibrates markedly
		  tense and unstable, like the car going over the
		  speed limit. An economic crisis is coldly read as
		  the crossing of an imaginary threshold at a critical
		  point on the exponential curve.

		<p>There is one fundamental thing that Lines of Flight
		  lacks, something more than a spectator, it needs a
		  human agency. Here the capitalist machine is the one
		  that is exposed, in its alienating nature. The
		  worker hides, in favor of the technical device.

		<p>In contrast, Daniel Rozin demonstrates how
		  technology informs the perception of our being
		  through its mechanical mirrors. “They are made of
		  various materials but share the same behavior and
		  interaction; Any person standing in front of one of
		  these pieces is instantly reflected in its surface”
		  (Rozin, 2019). The device is not hidden and the
		  viewer stops being an objective observer and becomes
		  a work of art. In all his work, the characteristic
		  sound of servomotors reveals his functioning, while
		  the chosen materiality says as much about itself as
		  it does about the person reflected. In Weave Mirror,
		  the artist makes this intention explicit, “its
		  circuitry and wiring is visible behind the picture
		  plane, exposing its craftsmanship” (Rozin,
		  2019). The trash mirror “suggests that we reflect in
		  what we discard” (Rozin, 2019) and the wooden one
		  “uses a warm, natural material to portray the
		  abstract notion of digital pixels” (Rozin,
		  2019). His work, despite everything, remains a
		  technological fascination. The game is too
		  entertaining. It is necessary that at some point the
		  thing stops working and gives you time to think:

		  <blockquote>Desiring-machines, [...], continually
		    break down while they operate, and in fact only
		    operate when they are not functioning correctly:
		    the product is always an offshoot of production,
		    which is implanted in it like a graft. and at the
		    same time, the parts of the machine are the fuel
		    that makes it work (Deleuze and Guattari, 1983,
		    p. 66-67).</blockquote>

		<p>The following is the way I approached the matter,
		  inspired by Rozin, I decided to design an interface
		  that would capture the user's movement in the room,
		  using the ultrasonic sensor that I had previously
		  tested. This only captures one dimension, on an axis
		  that does not allow much deviation, so in order to
		  traverse the space, an array of several of them must
		  be configured. Ten HC-SR04s wired in parallel, each
		  spaced 40cm apart (Image 2), are controlled by an
		  Arduino. The data is transmitted via serial
		  connection to a computer running Pure Data (Pd). The
		  Pd patch contains a code (Image 3), which translates
		  the numerical value of the distance measured by a
		  particular module, into a frequency to be reproduced
		  by a sine wave synthesizer. In this way, when
		  someone crosses the threshold and enters the range
		  of the sensor bar, the silence is broken and the
		  work begins. The instrument is analogous to a
		  theremin controlled with the entire body, rather
		  than just the hands, and lacks an amplitude control,
		  but can produce up to ten simultaneous tones,
		  allowing group performances. Up to this point the
		  work remains the same as Rozin, fulfilling the
		  second fundamental element of accelerationist art,
		  but without accounting for the first.

		<p>The other part of the work is the projection of a
		  video on the floor, in front of the sensor bar,
		  marking the area of to think: The following is the
		  way I approached the matter, inspired by Rozin, I

		  question is VQGAN + CLIP. What it does is that from
		  a text input, it generates an image that looks like
		  the words that the AI interpreted. The interesting
		  thing is that things happen from an iterative
		  process. One neuron makes the drawing and another
		  assigns a numerical value, which indicates the
		  similarity of the image, then the first adjusts the
		  drawing a little and obtains a new value, and so on
		  hundreds of times. The objective of the generative
		  adversarial network (GAN) is to maximize the
		  similarity to the images that exist in its database,
		  among which is the entire WikiArt collection. I give
		  inputs like: a black hole, the singularity,
		  human-machine fusion, time acceleration, etc.; the
		  kind of things I've been interested in and
		  studying. You can stop the generation process after
		  any desired number of iterations, I cut it after
		  about 300 images, because in that time the image has
		  already been roughly defined and more processing
		  only means greater detail or resolution, which tends
		  to close the figure and limit the
		  interpretation. From the last generated image, it
		  can be mutated into a new entry (Images 4, 5 and 6),
		  which is exactly what I do, then all the created
		  images are taken and used as frames for a video

		<p>At the same time as the video plays and the
		  oscillators sound, the former is manipulated in real
		  time. The sensor data is adjusted with mathematical
		  operations to translate the image in the Cartesian
		  plane and alter its reproduction speed.  The user's
		  dance causes movement in the X, Y, or Z axis of the
		  projection, as well as its temporal axis. In
		  addition, the opacity and saturation are altered,
		  allowing two or more different videos to be mixed,
		  which are played simultaneously, to symbolize the
		  divergence of evolutionary timelines. History is not
		  a uniform rectilinear movement, but rather a network
		  of causalities, in each decision. we diverge. The
		  effect that is produced is that the iterative
		  development of the drawing seems to be triggered by
		  the action of the user, although it has been
		  pre-produced by the AI. The idea is to question the
		  distinction between machine and human, to note that

		  <h3>Cybernetics, Automata and the Production of
		    Time</h3>

		<p>The central question that provokes and connects
		  all the concepts in my current project is: How
		  does time accelerate? My hypothesis is that it
		  is accelerated by devices that alter space, and
		  therefore, the interaction between bodies
		  located in the space-time network.  Posed the
		  other way around, my work seeks to account for
		  space through devices that act in time (because
		  we already live in a different space-time, in
		  increasing compression).

		<p>Having explored the spatiality of sound, he
		  felt that he must find a way to materialize the
		  invasion of sound in space. I couldn't just
		  occupy a wall, I wanted cyber-revolution, the
		  machines had to take over the room, so I decided
		  to do a site-specific installation.

		<p>What would my wishing-machines look like? They
		  had to be guardians of the threshold between
		  worlds, but they did not need to be physically
		  imposing, their strength would be in numbers,
		  they had to be everywhere, watching every
		  corner. It had motion sensors, which for
		  thousands of home-made robots, are the eyes of
		  the machine. How many eyes should they have, if
		  they have to look everywhere? not many, since
		  they would communicate with each other, but in
		  their status as liminal deities, it seemed
		  appropriate that they had two faces, like Ianus,
		  god of beginnings, gates, transitions, time,
		  duality, doors, passageways, frames and
		  endings. It also seemed to me that their design
		  should not be too elaborate, they should be
		  functional, like the machines that you find
		  controlling pedestrian traffic, totems with
		  anti-theft alarms placed to monitor the exits of
		  commercial stores, pedestals to form lines at
		  banks, etc.

		<p>The final materiality is a square head with
		  ultrasonic sensor eyes, like a children's toy,
		  scaled. This head is installed on a
		  pedestal. The device is made of metal, about 90
		  cm high and has an antenna on the top to
		  transmit sensor data wirelessly (Images 7 and
		  8).

		<p>He now had a way to collect data from the room,
		  but what to do with that information? I had
		  previously used it for synthesis, both audio and
		  images. Now I wanted the room to feel even more
		  alive, the animation had to be movement of
		  physical matter, the virtual would appear
		  through of the real. This became very
		  complicated, very expensive, very quickly. But I
		  had learned that a lot could be done, with the
		  simplest translation operation, a mapping of the
		  user's movement, to the movement of an
		  actuator. The cheapest motor I could find was an
		  SG-90, its 90 rotation angles can be controlled
		  by PWM, through Arduino. Naturally they have
		  very little torque, so they cannot move large
		  weights. What occurred to me was to configure a
		  network of threads, driven by these motors
		  (Images 9 and 10).

		<p>It then had an earthly world, controlled by
		  machines, and a heavenly world, where pulses of
		  information flow (Images 11, 12, 13 and
		  14). They were both connected and the Movement
		  of one led to movement of the other.

		<p>To place this installation in the context of
		  art I will analyze a key exhibition, Cybernetic
		  Serendipity, from 1968. The exhibition curated
		  by Jasia Reichardt “explored and demonstrated
		  some of the relationships between technology and
		  creativity” (Jasia Reichardt et al., 2018,
		  p. 5), at a time when that “computers [had] not
		  revolutionized music, nor art, nor poetry, in
		  the same way that they revolutionized science”
		  (p. 5). Among the participating artists were
		  John Cage, Nam June Paik, Jean Tinguely and
		  Edward Ihnatowicz; I will go into more detail
		  about their work in the following pages, but it
		  is worth noting that an important part of the
		  call was made up of engineers, mathematicians,
		  architects and "people who would never have put
		  pencil to paper, or brush to canvas" (p. 5), if
		  they have not been technically involved in the
		  development of systems to solve problems with
		  the support of images or sound.

		<p>These are definitions from the sample catalog:

		  <blockquote>
		    Adj. of cybernetics - science of control and
		    communication in complex electronic machines
		    such as computers and the human nervous
		    system” (p. 3).
		  </blockquote>

		  <blockquote>
		    "Serendipity – the faculty of making happy
		    chance discoveries” (p. 3).
		  </blockquote>

		<p>It is worth noting that like Deleuze and
		  Guattari, “we make no distinction between man
		  and nature” (Deleuze and Guattari, 1983,
		  p. 33). Norbert Wiener provides the first
		  definition, which is clearly political in nature
		  and explains: “When I give an order to a
		  machine, the situation is not essentially
		  different from that which occurs when I give an
		  order to a person” (Jasia Reichardt et al.,
		  2018). , p. 9). Cybernetics then studies the
		  input and output of feedback systems and its
		  purpose is “to develop a language and techniques
		  that allow us to attack the problem of control
		  and communication in general” (p. 9). This is
		  precisely what I am thinking about when
		  designing my devices, however, having passed
		  more than fifty years (The '60s are practically
		  the bronze age in terms of computing!) the
		  panorama is very different.

		<p>At the beginning of the internet there was a
		  great expectation that this technology could
		  revolutionize the world. Access to information
		  and global interconnection would break down the
		  borders that divide humanity, something that
		  Bourriaud notes in Radicante:

		  <blockquote>
		    “Without a doubt, we could formulate the
		    ambition of the 21st century artist by saying
		    that he or she tries to transform themselves
		    into a network. The modernity of the 20th
		    century was based on the coupling of the human
		    with the industrial machine, ours faces
		    computer science and reticular lines.”
		    (Bourriaud, 2009, p. 155).
		  </blockquote>

		<p>I think his approach is a little old-fashioned,
		  since disillusionment was already experienced in
		  the '90s. The technical implementation of a
		  network is not enough, there must also be a
		  political organization to generate meaning from
		  it, if this is lacking what you get is a
		  cacophony, or in the worst case, conflict, since
		  it is easier to interact with a central unit,
		  than negotiating a group consensus. There is
		  therefore an absolutist potential in the
		  technological domain. It seems then that art and
		  technology are going in opposite directions.
		  Programming is essentially deterministic, while
		  art, “if you want to define it, is a criminal
		  action. It doesn't conform to any rules. Not
		  even their own” (Jasia Reichardt et al., 2018,
		  p. 25), writes John Cage, who participated in
		  the exhibition, with his experimental score,
		  Fontana Mix, it consisted of ten transparent
		  sheets with graphs, lines and points, to be
		  interpreted as melodies and rhythms. By
		  overlapping the leaves, Their arrangements and
		  different combinations give rise to very
		  different compositions.  The rhizomatic
		  character of the work is what is essential for
		  me, it incorporates the non-signifying rupture
		  and the conjunction and... and... ...and, but
		  not falling into an automatism that produces
		  meaningless scribbles. I seek to configure
		  something of this style in my work, I want it to
		  be possible to connect to the machine from any
		  point and for everything to happen at the same
		  time.

		<p>Cage's critical perspective on technology makes
		  him work with chance, serendipity.  In his diary
		  (1966) he notes “Are we an audience for computer
		  art? The answer is not No; is Yes. What we need
		  is a computer that does not save work, but
		  rather increases the work we have to do, that
		  makes word games (this is McLuhan's idea)”
		  (p. 24). This is precisely what we need! The
		  production logic of the computer is inverted
		  with an anti- operational machine, which demands
		  movement from the user instead of functioning
		  autonomously.

		<p>Nam June Paik is in dialogue with John Cage,
		  not only on this occasion, but also because they
		  are both part of Fluxus:

		  <blockquote>
		    “[This] is a loosely knit association of
		    artists whose activity ranges from concerts,
		    films, performances and sightseeing, to games,
		    sports, instruments and gadgets. It includes
		    names such as Yoko Ono, Mieko Shiomi, George
		    Maciunas, Nam June Paik, Takehisa Kosugi, La
		    Monte Young, Alison Knowles, Dick Higgins and
		    Ken Friedman, and spans a period of almost
		    five decades. (Lushetich, 2011, p. 76).
		  </blockquote>

		<p>What I rescue from Fluxus is the game, “art-fun
		  must be simple, fun, unpretentious, concerned
		  with insignificance, that does not require
		  skills or endless rehearsals, that has no value
		  either institutionally or as a commodity”
		  (Trillnick) . Although the engineering behind my
		  installation is very complex, in practice people
		  relate to the pieces in a very intuitive
		  way. This is also highlighted by Ihnatowicz:
		  “Cybernetic art is, by its very nature,
		  immediately accessible, so much so that children
		  are its most appreciative viewers” (Ihnatowicz,
		  1986, p. 3).

		<p>For Cybernetic Serendipity, Nam June Paik
		  collaborated with CRT televisions whose image
		  could be manipulated by magnets, Tango
		  Électronique and with his Robot K-456. It was
		  very important that people intervene themselves
		  on television sets.

		<p>“Let them play,” said Mr. Paik, “that's what
		  they are for. If something breaks, the Art
		  Department will pay for it.” “Okay, what does
		  that all mean?” (Jasia Reichardt et al., 2018,
		  p. 42), they asked him. Lushetich proposes a
		  very interesting idea in The Performance of Time
		  in the Intermedia of Fluxus:

		  <blockquote>
		    “I would like to suggest what might be called
		    a 'processualist' approach, according to which
		    time is the expressive activity of any thing,
		    being or phenomenon. Instead of occurring in
		    time, an event or activity produces time in
		    its occurrence, which further means that there
		    can be no position outside of time, since all
		    things, beings and phenomena are always
		    temporalized by nature itself. of its
		    existence.” (2011, p. 76)
		  </blockquote>

		<p>This comes very close to answering my initial
		  hypothesis, as Land says: “In the technocosm
		  nothing is given, everything is produced” (Land,
		  2018, p. 321). Of course that is to completely
		  lose the spirit of Fluxus. Again Land answers
		  better than me:

		  <blockquote>
		    “Philosophy, in its desire to rationalize,
		    formalize, define, delimit, to do away with
		    enigma and uncertainty, to cooperate
		    wholeheartedly with the police, is nihilistic
		    in the ultimate sense that it strives for the
		    motionless perfection of death. But creativity
		    cannot have an end compatible with power,
		    since, unless life is extinguished, control
		    must inevitably be broken. We possess the art
		    so as not to perish from the truth. To
		    conclude is not simply wrong, but ugly”
		    (p. 174).
		  </blockquote>

		<p>“Okay, what does that all mean?” (Jasia
		  Reichardt et al., 2018, p. 42), they asked
		  him. Lushetich proposes a very interesting idea
		  in The Performance of Time in the Intermedia of
		  Fluxus: For Cybernetic Serendipity, Nam June
		  Paik collaborated with CRT televisions whose
		  image could be manipulated by magnets, Tango
		  Électronique and with his Robot K-456. It was
		  very important that people intervene themselves
		  on television sets.  This comes very close to
		  answering my initial hypothesis, as Land says:
		  “In the technocosm nothing is given, everything
		  is produced” (Land, 2018, p. 321). Of course
		  that is to completely lose the spirit of
		  Fluxus. Again Land answers better than me: There
		  are things that we do not need to understand,
		  but rather experience. There is a very popular
		  quote by Arthur C. Clarke that describes the
		  situation perfectly: "Any sufficiently advanced
		  technology is indistinguishable from magic." If
		  you know how the trick works, it stops being
		  surprising. When inaugurated Cybernetic
		  Serendipity, there was a lot of excitement about
		  the possibilities that technology opened
		  up. Today it is difficult to arouse such
		  feelings because the accelerated flow of
		  information and planned obsolescence makes you
		  perceive everything as disposable and
		  surmountable. Even the artificial intelligence
		  that only a few years ago amazed the world,
		  today is freely available for mass use and
		  instead of elevating artistic practice, it has
		  displaced human labor in the creation of images,
		  for example, in stock photography , or
		  illustration. In other words, due to its rapid
		  development, it has become a tool of technical
		  reproduction, rather than a space for aesthetic
		  experimentation.

		<p>Which is not to say that it does not still have
		  that potential, just that to access it, users
		  must implement the code on their own, instead of
		  having websites with a simple interface, through
		  which they can exploit the
		  algorithms. production by artificial neural
		  networks.

		<p>The disappointment is not only aesthetic, but
		  also political. Mcluhan's Electronic
		  SuperHighway , produced by Paik, was effectively
		  privatized, like any other highway. The
		  decentralized internet has been replaced by
		  authoritarian control of social networks, which
		  are actively researching how to keep their users
		  addicted through psychological manipulation. The
		  Iron Curtain is no longer there, but China's
		  Great Firewall and its Russian parallel do
		  exist. Egypt and Turkey simply turn off the
		  national internet in case the protests get out
		  of control. The war against drugs and terrorism
		  was won by drugs and terrorism, in part thanks
		  to technological resistance, but all control and
		  espionage measures were extended to include the
		  entire population, all the time. I think people
		  resignedly accept these setbacks partly out of
		  convenience; it's easier to create an Instagram
		  account than to design your own website. "I'm
		  not worried about privacy, I have nothing to
		  hide."  Reflection on television videos
		  manipulated by Nam June Paik's audience is that
		  “the mass media is essentially passive [...]
		  Passive art is a true threat to our culture. If
		  the viewer does not enter the art, he has no
		  chance of understanding it” (Jasia Reichardt et
		  al., 2018, p. 42) and if art produces reality,
		  then its revolutionary potential is
		  (un)intentionally wasted.

		<p>In this new context, I want to compare the work
		  of Jean Tinguely, Edward Ihnatowicz, and Theo
		  Jansen, because for me they represent three very
		  different historical attitudes towards
		  technological development and yet they start
		  from the same point, the machine as a living
		  being.

		<p>For all the design of his work reflects its
		  purpose, about the SAM, Ihnatowicz says that “it
		  was an exercise in developing forms through a
		  strictly functional discipline, with the hope
		  that the final appearance would be a reflection
		  of both the motif as well as the method” (1986,
		  p. 3). The same thing happens with living
		  organisms, due to natural selection.

		<p>In this line of research we can place Theo
		  Jansen, with the evolution of his Strandbeest,
		  but what characterizes Ihnatowicz is the
		  introduction of a sensitive device, the
		  microphone, and its translation into movement
		  through computer programming. I have focused my
		  work on the latter, primarily because I am
		  concerned about the social dimension of the
		  device. We can imagine Theo's beasts walking in
		  a world without humans, but Edward's Senster
		  would be completely immobilized; Although there
		  is sound that could activate it in nature, in
		  "ancient life everything was silent. In the
		  nineteenth century, with the invention of
		  machines, noise was born" (Russolo, 1998,
		  p. 7). On the other hand, something truly
		  cultural is multiplicity; there is nothing pure
		  in culture, so, rather than generating a
		  personal experience with the sculpture, the
		  installation must involve a collective. For this
		  reason I move away from the Senster, in favor of
		  an installation where cooperation is essential
		  to establish order, or break the state of
		  equilibrium.

		<p>Quite the opposite (Or perhaps precisely the
		  same?) is the kinetic art of Jean Tinguely,
		  where the human being is excluded. His work
		  could be considered neo-dada, since it deals
		  with the absurd overproduction and automation
		  post-industrial revolution, which reaches the
		  point of total alienation. It is immediately
		  reminiscent of Duchamp's wheel, which was sadly
		  captured by the institutions of art, becoming
		  completely immobilized.

		<p>Ihnatowicz is perhaps the most naïve of the
		  three, saying that he “can embrace the new
		  revolution and use new discoveries to improve
		  his understanding of the world.” (Ihnatowicz,
		  1986, p. 4), Heidegger provides the most
		  accurate criticism: “As long as we conceive
		  technique as an instrument, we will remain
		  attached to wanting to master it and we will
		  omit the essence of technique” (Heidegger, 1997,
		  p. 144).

		<p>Jean Tinguely pursues the flow of excessive
		  desire, the process becomes more important than
		  the end and the subject becomes a mere residue
		  of it. “The subject itself is not in the center,
		  which is occupied by the machine, but is on the
		  periphery, without fixed identity, forever
		  decentred, defined by the states through which
		  it passes” (Deleuze and Guattari, 1983, p . 53).

		<p>Finally Theo Jansen seems to detach himself,
		  and decisively shows us something that I would
		  call "accelerationist art." He works from the
		  position of a creator god, setting in motion
		  (pro-duces) the process of evolution of
		  creatures with machinic desires, such as
		  perpetual movement, escaping death by avoiding
		  drowning in the sea, lubricating their joints,
		  rising above the sand to not ending up buried,
		  etc., is a “radicant” art – a term that
		  designates an organism that makes its roots grow
		  as it advances.

		<p>(Bourriaud, 2009, p. 22). They are not just
		  kinetic sculptures for aesthetic enjoyment, but
		  are a true advance in the area of robotics. But
		  the exaltation of human ingenuity is sublimated
		  to the post-human, there is a point in the
		  future, at which machines no longer need to be
		  initiated, they are free of humanity and they
		  evolve in a matter of years, with new appendages
		  developing in each time less time. The
		  abandonment of the human in the technical is
		  what Nick Land writes about and is something
		  that is present in the work of Deleuze and
		  Guattari, Heidegger and Marx. ”Capitalism is
		  like an organism, right? ...but an organism that
		  evolved too quickly to develop a reliable immune
		  system” (Land, 2018, p.  377). “Technique is the
		  destiny of our time; where destiny lies: the
		  fatality of an unalterable course” (Heidegger,
		  1997, p. 136).

		<p>Although I established the entry of my problem
		  into the cultural scene in the 20th century, the
		  topic of automation (and therefore, cybernetics)
		  can be traced back to ancient Greece, or even
		  further back if we refer to chronicles of
		  automatons. incredible Chinese. These stories go
		  through "deception", the machines seem alive;
		  then there is a conflict, authority is offended;
		  and finally there is a revelation of the
		  functioning together with the praise of creative
		  ingenuity. We find them in China, Egypt and
		  Greece, with different engineers showing their
		  work to kings who then, astonished, order
		  more. Unfortunately we only have texts to verify
		  its existence, many without explaining the
		  operation of the machines, except for some
		  designs by Heron of Alexandria and
		  Ctesibius. The creation of automata is what
		  allows us to connect matters that seem too
		  modern, with an antiquity that dreamed of beings
		  that fly through the skies, travel to space,
		  transit between worlds, create artificial life,
		  themes typical of science fiction. “Imagination,
		  in effect, accelerated all possibilities”
		  (Garfield, 2017, p. 42). Accelerationism has a
		  concept to refer to this, hyperstition, it is a
		  fiction that feeds back to the social technical
		  machine until it produces its own
		  reality. Before the trip to the moon, there were
		  movies about it, before the mastery of flight,
		  there were the designs of Leonardo Da Vinci,
		  before the stomach grown in a laboratory, there
		  was Vaucanson's duck, before the word processor,
		  there was The Writer by Pierre
		  Jaquet-Droz. Could any of them imagine what we
		  would be capable of? Nietzsche echoes through
		  Deleuze and Land: the truth is that we have not
		  seen anything yet.
