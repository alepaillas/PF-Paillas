		<h3 id="secularized">Secularized religious expression in social justice protests</h3>

		<p>We can find features or characteristics of religious expression in the movements for social justice that have their origin in sacred doctrines or beliefs, which today they manifest themselves outside of this context and in this sense, they have become secularized.

		<p>Of the major problems that must be faced at a global level, we can highlight without assuming
		  priorities, global warming, gender equality and racial justice or racism
		  systematized. To combat these issues, multiple organizations have emerged, both
		  institutional and grassroots, made up of people from the community, political parties,
		  governments, NGOs, etc. Most movements find their foundation in
		  declaration of human rights so it can be said that they are this way,
		  liberals, but that does not mean that the church does not speak out on the matter, but the issue of
		  The following essay will focus on the former, since a distinction is assumed between
		  both that tends to define one as rational/logical and the other as strictly dogmatic or
		  even emotional/sentimental respectively. We will see that it is not so easy to separate
		  both positions and that their speeches often function in essence, in the same way.

		<p>There is a lot that could be written about climate change, I still remember the first time
		  heard about it, I must have been about five years old, a group of activists prepared in my
		  school quite a presentation for children in first, second and third grade. In her
		  In addition to the small theater that we saw and eating small food, we were shown the terrible situation
		  Polar bears were going to disappear! On the other hand, the planet was warming and the layer
		  ozone was torn but the truth is they didn't seem like such big problems in comparison. Such
		  moment marked my baptism into green activism, even before my first communion.
		  But leaving aside the story with which Greta Thunberg was robbed of her childhood, there is a
		  particular phrase that attracts a lot of attention: “The science is settled.” Translated here
		  as science is established. How can such a statement be true? Weber, on
		  science and progress tells us: “every “finished achievement” of science means new
		  "questions" and has the will to remain outdated and be "superseded" (Max Weber, “La ciencia como profesión”, p. 55). Of course
		  This statement is not rescued by way of dismissing science or falling into the terrible sin
		  of denying human participation in the environmental crisis, but rather allows us to give ourselves
		  It takes into account what we are operating with when pronouncing such words. It's not with the logos
		  scientific, because the consensus among researchers is with the effect of the activity of the
		  man in the warming of the planet, not with the solution to the problem itself. Is he
		  appeal to authority where activism meets Catholic religiosity? No
		  really, but partially it could be, the closest to such an argument is perhaps the place
		  apocalyptic that represents the world catastrophe.

		<p>Understanding global warming as the imminent end of the world is that we begin to
		  dialogue from the properly theological. Science is not capable of making moral judgments or
		  enact ethical laws, even on matters involving all of humanity, such as a rise in global temperature or the current COVID-19 pandemic. These without
		  However, they are primary matters of religion. The apocalypse as final judgment, retribution
		  divine for our deplorable acts works for both the biblical flood and the
		  coming desertification. The decline of beliefs, postulated as one of the sub-theses of
		  José Casanova, would not be expressed as a step towards the era of complete rationality, in
		  change what happens here is a replacement. As belief in God is lost
		  Christian, nature regains strength as a deity, it is re-sacralized. Sin is not
		  then forgetting the commandments, on the contrary, focusing solely on them has
		  result in abandoning Mother Nature. A new paganism has sprung up, which is not
		  Weber's rationalized old gods, is literally the surrender to a new
		  spirituality that possesses the individual. In it he finds a meaning that the
		  scientific knowledge.

		<p>Incorporating the new ideology changes the person, he no longer only has rational guides, but
		  that are equally ethical. And he faces something that he is not capable of fighting and defeating: the
		  global capitalist system. Naturally the reaction is to activism, which is nothing other than
		  evangelize, but given the ineffectiveness of the act he turns to his inner being. How can you not
		  stop the container ship that pollutes more in a single trip than your car will do
		  In all his life, there is comfort in clearing his conscience. So he will try to use less
		  water, recycle, reuse and reduce your waste, adopt a vegan diet, etc. It happens
		  then from a Christian ascetic, to a green ascetic. What little effect this has
		  Achieving his big goals is irrelevant, the point is that he makes a change in his community.
		  local and feels at peace, the same functions that religion fulfills in a practical sense.

		<p>It is worth pausing to explain the meaning of the secularization that is being worked on,
		  understands the process of secularization, the passing of rites, doctrines, beliefs that some
		  They once belonged to Christianity (or other institutions) towards life outside the church.
		  What happens to content once it falls into “the mundane sphere” is not
		  necessarily a rationalization of it, but can become sacred once again, in
		  a new religion. Thus secularization is not something progressive in history, not at all.
		  less defines what is modern, it is simply a phenomenon of institutionalized religion, which
		  is incapable of controlling everything, since there is nothing pure in nature, nor anything new
		  under the sun. Hence we can understand that for Berger “... the roots of secularization
		  We must look for them in the oldest sources that we know today of the religion of the
		  ancient Israel.” (Peter Berger, “The Process of Secularization,” in The Sacred Canopy, p. 163.) because the awareness of the religious implies a discourse or logos
		  critical of himself, which for Judaism was something rational, but in the encounter with other
		  cultures, what is born from syncretism is not purely rational.

		<p>Let us return then to global warming, once we understand that the arguments have
		  greater power and involve people more when wielded with symbolism and
		  religious rituality we can say that in reality we talk about the same thing with different
		  words. Then it is truly possible to dialogue and work for common solutions. The
		  proposal is that of Pope Francis, systematized in his encyclical Laudato si 'and his was more
		  recent revelation on the day of the immaculate conception, with the participation of the vatican
		  in the council for inclusive capitalism, together with CEOs of the largest
		  banking institutions, with the same objective of updating the technocratic paradigm, which does not
		  the logic of exploitation predominates, but that of the care of the common home, as it says in
		  his own words.

		<p>It is also worth focusing on other social problems, since they clearly show
		  Likewise a religious attitude, it is necessary to ask if the disenchantment of the
		  world occurs in a famous phrase of the North American feminist movement, “Believe all
		  women” of #MeToo, here sometimes located as “Friend, I believe you.” It is interesting the
		  choice of words, because it is not difficult to find evidence that supports situations of
		  widespread violence against women and yet the call is not to talk more with the
		  another genre or stop to listen, it is enough to believe. An inverted logic is assumed here,
		  similar to that of the decolonial Christianity-Christianity turn. The fact that the same system
		  who has perpetuated injustices must be the one to judge whether a case really corresponds to
		  Rape is a type of structural violence. Statistics make suffering invisible
		  individual and sometimes serve to erase the other. Then faith is born as an alternative and becomes
		  necessary to discuss from the same terms that the group conceives, before hegemony
		  cultural. In the same way, one does not think of doing theology without believing in God. The opening to
		  mystery allows us to build a consistent discourse without falling into the arrogance of power
		  capture everything, that is why it is possible to understand the expression as religious, in the sense
		  community that implies and not merely esoteric.

		<p>There are many other cases that could be cited to justify the thesis that the demonstrations
		  social organizations operate from a primarily religious sense, for example, the Black Lives
		  Matter of asking to kneel and raise your fist towards the sky or perform minutes of silence
		  which means recognizing your position of privilege, becoming aware of a kind of sin
		  original in the founding of the American states; but the matter has already been clarified at the level
		  essential. It is important to note two key points, one that the future of history does not point to.
		  necessarily towards a rationalization of all things, but the openness to
		  Mystery, religious expression, has existed throughout humanity and does not seem to stop doing so anytime soon; two, this implies that dialogue from a religious perspective is not only possible
		  but it becomes fundamental for a true global understanding of the issues. It doesn't work
		  easy to separate phenomena as purely logical-rational or product of a
		  mystical thought, but this also means that the discussion can shift focus to
		  solutions that are capable of uniting rather than dividing.
